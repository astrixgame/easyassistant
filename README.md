Featuring voice recognition technology, the intelligent Easy Assistant responds instantly to voice commands, such as turning lights on or off, adjusting thermostat settings. It can detect your presence, and automatically adjust the temperature, lighting and other settings to create a comfortable environment while also conserving energy.<br>Now the assistant must be connected to the main controller like Loxone or Home Assistant or something else.
